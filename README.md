# BME-FON-Talerin

**BME-FON-Talerin** is a learning-focused project within the **Before Month's End - Finished Or Not (BME-FON)** series.

This project follows a monthly, time-boxed format. Each BME-FON project begins on the **first day of the month** and concludes on the **last day of the month**, regardless of completion state.

For this iteration, the project runs from:

📅 **February 1, 2026 → February 28, 2026**

## Project Intent

This repository serves as an exploration of **the design and implementation of a Sudoku validator**.

The goal of this project is to create an app that can take in Sudoku puzzles and validate if it is correctly solved.

Rather than targeting a single polished solution, the emphasis is on experimentation, iteration, and learning through implementation.

---

## Areas of Exploration

Areas planned during this project include:

- Displaying Sudoku puzzles on web pages  
- Validating Sudoku puzzles using a rules-based system  
- Saving and sharing user-created puzzles  
- Implementing a Sudoku solver to verify whether a puzzle has at least one valid solution 

The focus throughout is on understanding workflows and constraints rather than producing a finalized, production-ready application.

---

## Scope & Flexibility

This project is intentionally exploratory.

The scope may shift throughout the month as new ideas, constraints, or opportunities are discovered. Some features may remain incomplete or experimental as part of the learning process.

---

## BME-FON Philosophy

This project follows the **Finished Or Not** approach:

- Time-boxed learning
- Progress over perfection
- Iteration over abandonment

The repository represents learning in motion rather than a finalized product.
