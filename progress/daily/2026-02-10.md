## Completions
- CSS
    - Fixed grid to now look like sudoku grid.
    - Started setting up ability to click on cells

## Next Focus
- Initial Pages
    - Finish setup up ability to select cell when it is clicked.
    - Update initial page to allow cells that are not setup initially to be changed

## Notes
- Removing reseach from next focus as this is something that isn't important right now.
- Grids in html are janky, trying to get the grid to look like a sudoku grid required weird css styling with padding.
- Clicking on cells is straight forward, but requires a bit more work.
