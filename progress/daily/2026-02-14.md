## Completions
- Sudoku Page
    - Worked on making the selection of the cell work properly and create way for pencilmarks to be easily added.

## Next Focus
- Sudoku Page
    - Fix Page so that selection works on page change and not reload
    - Update initial page to allow cells that are not setup initially to be changed

## Notes
- Z-index with position allowed for 3 different divs to occupy the same space without affecting each other.
- I still need to figure out why the div inside of the div is not triggering the click event for selection.
