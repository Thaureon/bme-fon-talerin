## Completions
- Sudoku Page
    - Got the child and parent components to communicate in a way that allows the child to update from calls to the parent 
    - Updated page so that values can be inserted and are saved on the C# side.

## Next Focus
- Sudoku Page
    - Fix Page so that selection works on page change and not reload
    - Allow inserting of new pencilmarks
    - Toggle Pencil marks to remove it from list

## Notes
- The hardest part of getting the numbers to changes was making sure that the child component was the one that was updating the value as the parent will handle the initial load and validating of the board.
- Finding out how to link the parent and child was annoying as some pieces didn't works since they would be done after the page was rendered and after the C# parts updated everything.
- There are some possible bugs that need to be addressed with updating cells with values and selecting the correct cell.
