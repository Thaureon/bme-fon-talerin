## Completions
- Sudoku Page
    - Got the selecting of cells mostly working
    - Got pencil marks abile to show up in groups of 3 per row

## Next Focus
- Sudoku Page
    - Fix Page so that selection works on page change and not reload
    - Allow inserting of new values other than what was originally there

## Notes
- Selecting of cells is going through javascript and needs to have it load on the initial page load and not refresh.
- Need to figure out blazor on key pressed for certain keys.
