## Completions
- Sudoku Page
    - Selecting of cells works with arrow and wasd keys
    - Selecting cells also fixed tab focus so tabbing moved to next cell instead of just last selected cell

## Next Focus
- Sudoku Page
    - Fix Page so that selection works on page change and not reload
    - Allow inserting of new values other than what was originally there

## Notes
- Now that selecting cells is good, I need to start focusing on editing the values there.
