## Completions

    - Created page that displays sudoku grid.
    - Got initial layout for sudoku grid on page.
    - Got sudoku data being pulled from database.
- Sudoku Puzzles
    - Added first puzzle to database

## Next Focus
- Initial Pages
    - Update initial page to allow cells that are not setup initially to be changed
- Research
    - Research best practices for blazor contacting a DB
- CSS
    - Fix grid to fill the page instead of having a scroll.

## Notes
- Initial sudoku is pulled from New York Times easy for 2/7.
- DB is just injected into page.  This is not a good practice, but it was done to get page initially working.
- Custom grid layout is based on grid format for w3schools
- Still need to adjust grid to look better.
