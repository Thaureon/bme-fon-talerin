## Completions
- Database setup
    - Create basic tables for Sudoku grid and rules.

## Next Focus
- Database setup
    - Make sure DB is being created and access on SQL Express
    - Add first 3 rules (row, column, box)
- Initial Pages
    - Create page that displays sudoku grid.

## Notes
- Don't want to make Id public so adding a slug later for the sudoku is the next choice.
- Grid right now is just size, this will be fine for basic, but will need to change for some types.
- Need to figure out the Cells on the Sudoku model and Cells on the SudokuRules model.
- Need to figure out if I want each row to be its own rule or just have 1 rule for all rows.
    - One row may be better as this would also allow that row to hold all of the groups of cells IE, 9 sets of cells.
    - This would help to limit the number of rows and allow multiple of the same rules to be applied.
