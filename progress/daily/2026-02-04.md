## Completions
- Database setup
    - Made sure DB is being created and access on SQL Express
    - Added first 3 rules (row, column, box)
- Initial Pages
    - Researched other sudoku apps to understand different creating it.

## Next Focus
- Initial Pages
    - Create page that displays sudoku grid.
- Sudoku Puzzles
    - Find first puzzle to setup

## Notes
- Other apps use everything from javascript to SVGs to canvases.
- Redo and Undo like in the SudokuPad app are handled by using UndoStacks and going back and forth between them.
    - This can be pretty easy if I want to look into making that a thing.
    - This would also need undo and redo buttons as well as ctrlZ and ctrlY
- To make the sudoku grid I want to experiment a bit with how Blazor would be able to do it and handles this.
