## Completions
- Initial Pages
    - Moved cell out to be handled independently
- CSS
    - Researched ways to handle scaling the window

## Next Focus
- Initial Pages
    - Update initial page to allow cells that are not setup initially to be changed
- Research
    - Research best practices for blazor contacting a DB
- CSS
    - Fix grid to fill the page instead of having a scroll.

## Notes
- Initial design of having everything be handled by C# wasn't really useful.
- Adding the JS executable in C# makes things overly complex.
