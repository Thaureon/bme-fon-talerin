## Completions
- Initial Pages
    - Fixed up some styling to allow cell to be centered.
- CSS
    - Fixed grid to fill the page instead of having a scroll.

## Next Focus
- Initial Pages
    - Update initial page to allow cells that are not setup initially to be changed
- Research
    - Research best practices for blazor contacting a DB

## Notes
- Dropped the idea of scaling to just get the initial page working, will want to go back to trying to get the scale working later.
- Grid now is the size of min between width and height.
    - This will work for scaling for now.
