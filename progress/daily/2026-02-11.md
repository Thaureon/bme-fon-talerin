## Completions
- Initial Page
    - Fixed html to allow selecting and deselecting of cells

## Next Focus
- Initial Pages
    - Fix Page so that selection works on page change and not reload
    - Update initial page to allow cells that are not setup initially to be changed

## Notes
- Javascript was not loading fulling when just navigating between pages, upon reloading the page fully did the javascript finally work.
- Selecting and deselecting works, but has one final bug.
- With this I can start applying the ability to input a value into the cell.
