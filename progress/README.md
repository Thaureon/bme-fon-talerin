# Progress Tracking

This directory contains ongoing updates and reflections recorded
throughout the project.

## Structure

- `daily/`
  Optional, lightweight notes capturing day-to-day activity.

- `weekly/`
  Weekly summaries that consolidate progress, challenges, and direction.
  These serve as the primary progress record and are typically written on Saturday to reflect on the complete week.

- `retrospective.md`
  A final project reflection completed at the end of the month.

## Notes

Daily entries may be sparse or skipped.

Weekly entries act as the anchor for tracking progress and are intended
to summarize learning and direction at the end of each week rather than
documenting activity in real time.
